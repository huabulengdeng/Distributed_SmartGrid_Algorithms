# Distributed_SmartGrid_Algorithms

##### This Repository contains implementation of 3 different algorithms for Economic Dispatch In Smart-Grids.  
The Motivation for this was to explore and compare different ways of optimizing energy management using only local information in Micro-Grids for a Final Project in EECS 647: *Distributed Optimization*

#### Algorithms:
 * [Bisection](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6987376/#full-text-section)
 * [Consensus + Innovation](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6345156/)
 * [Proportional Control](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6560423/)
